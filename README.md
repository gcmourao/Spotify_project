# :musical_note: Spotify SDK Project  

## :pushpin: About  

In **Week 2 of Course 2** of the [Data Engineering Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/data-engineering?) by DeepLearning.ai, there's an interesting lab on **web APIs**, using the **Spotify Web API** as an example.  

The lab extensively explores API usage via the `requests` library and briefly introduces the **Spotify SDK**. Since the SDK part was only lightly covered, I decided to **dive deeper** and explore it further.  

## :question: What is an SDK?  

An **SDK (Software Development Kit)** is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, and code samples that help developers build applications for a specific platform, framework, or service.  

### What's inside an SDK?  
- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** Predefined functions to interact with a system or service.  
- **Libraries:** Pre-written code to handle common tasks.  
- **Documentation:** Guides and references explaining how to use the SDK.  
- **Sample Code:** Example projects or scripts demonstrating usage.  
- **Debugging Tools:** Software to help test and fix issues.  

## :page_with_curl: Documentation  

For this exercise, I used the **Spotipy** package. You can find the documentation here: [Spotipy Docs](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/#getting-started).  

## :grinning: Fun Fact  

The results of this exercise **leave no doubt** that I have a young kid at home! :notes: :baby:
